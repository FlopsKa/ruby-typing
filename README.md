If you already have [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) the installation is really simple:

    cd ruby-typing
    bundle install
    
After you entered those commands into the console you can run the program with:

    camping typing.rb

and start typing. To stop the server press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal 
window.


Information
-----------
The program analyzes your wrong characters and shows the most frequent 
mistakes you made on the 'Statistics' page. Use that to your advantage
and get rid of them.

When you don't want to supply your own wordlist you can use the included
one. It's auto generated and features the most common english words.
